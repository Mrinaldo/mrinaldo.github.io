I design at the intersection of systems, strategy, and storytelling, where ideas aren’t just imagined, they’re engineered to work.\n\nI move between automation systems, consumer apps, and brand ecosystems because I start with structure. I ask the hard questions. I design within constraints. I measure outcomes. I don’t chase trends. I build things that hold.\n\nIf it works, it’s intentional. If it matters, it lasts.\n\nWhen I’m not designing, I’m blasting rock, hunting the perfect cup of coffee, or staring at the night sky, still scheming ways to make things better.",resumeUrl:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/14h9DGZ1Wibg5OqbFg0E99bN-EGF7CPvG/view?usp=sharing",email:"sara.dharmik@gmail.com",socials:[{name:"LinkedIn",url:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sara-dharmik-ba4104247"},{name:"Instagram",url:"https://www.instagram.com/illustratvio/?igsh=MW16MGd4bWVxeGdwaA%3D%3D&utm_source=qr"}],experience:[{company:"Adobe",role:"Campus Ambassador",description:"Promote Adobe’s creative ecosystem within the student design community by sharing resources, exploring new features, and integrating tools into personal and academic projects.
